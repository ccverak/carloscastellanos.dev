I'm a polyglot software engineer with over 10 years of development experience primarily in building backend systems for web and mobile applications. During this time I have focused not only in technical details but also in software architectures and good practices for building and growing systems. I love coding, reading, learning and sharing my experiences with others.

Programming languages wise, `Ruby` and `Javascript` (`Node.js`) are my strong suit nowadays, although I have never left `Python` aside. I have also used `Java` extensively in the past the same as `PHP`. Aside from that, I enjoy spending time testing out different languages across the paradigm and type system spectrum so I've done things in my spare time with `Elixir`, `Elm`.

Experience Overview:

- Ruby, Javascript, Python, Java
- DevOps
- Serverless
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, DynamoDB, PostgreSQL.
- Software architectures
