# About me

I'm a polyglot software engineer with over 10 years of development experience primarily in building backend systems for web and mobile applications. During this time I have focused not only in technical details but also in software architectures and good practices for building and growing systems. I'm very motivated by solving problems and bringing things to life. I love coding, reading, learning and sharing my experiences with others.

Programming languages wise, `Ruby` and `Javascript` (`Node.js`) are my strong suit nowadays, although I have never left `Python` aside. I have also used `Java` extensively in the past the same as `PHP`. Aside from that, I enjoy spending time testing out different languages across the paradigm and type system spectrum so I've done things in my spare time with `Elixir`, `Elm`.

Experience Overview:

- Ruby, Javascript, Python, Java
- DevOps
- Serverless
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, DynamoDB, PostgreSQL.
- Software architectures
