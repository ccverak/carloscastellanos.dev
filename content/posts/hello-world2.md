This is my first post
I'm a polyglot software engineer with over _10 years_ of development experience primarily in building backend systems for web and mobile applications. Programming languages wise, _Ruby_ and _Javascript_ are my strong suit nowadays, but I have also worked with Java, C#, Python, Delphi, and PHP in the past. Aside from that, I enjoy spending time testing out different languages across the paradigm and type system spectrum so I've done things in my spare time with Elixir, Elm, Rust, and Go.

My main focus is to bringing things to life and solving problems. I'm a passionate reader and learner and a web development enthusiast.

Experience overview:

- APIs, Large data processing, Scalability, Search platforms.
- DevOps, System administration, Automation, Amazon Web Services (AWS), AWS Lambda, Linux.
- MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch, DynamoDB, PostgreSQL.
- Serverless, Ruby on Rails, Ruby, Javascript, NodeJS, TDD, BDD.
