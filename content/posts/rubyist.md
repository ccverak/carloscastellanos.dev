description: "Rubyist by accident"

It was 2011, I was a Java developer on that time, I was comfortable with libraries and tooling I used; I was productive and happy user of Play Framework, Spring Framework, and several other libraries and frameworks. I thought I had it all. After reading Andrew Hunt’s and David Thomas’s The Pragmatic Programmer I planned to start learning some programming language on my spare time to grow my programming skills.

At that time I only had Java and J2EE ebooks on my hand but looking for something to learn by accident I found a demo from Netbeans of a Depot application written en Ruby using Ruby on Rails, having nothing else what to read I decided to dig into code details. It seemed pretty awesome for a first look, in matters of simplicity and legibility, so I decided to give it a shot and planned to find some books to read about.

Ruby language was created by [Yukihiro_Matsumoto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto) (Matz) in 1993. His goal was to create a language for developer happiness and productivity by using the best ideas from languages as Perl, Lisp, Smalltalk, etc, you will find this everywhere telling Ruby story, but this post is not about that story, this is a story of how I got engaged with the language.

Book in hand my first impact was huge, it was a very versatile language, there was a method for everything, there was tons of gems all along with a very organized, vibrant and smart community which counts with [Ruby-Toolbox](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/) which is a fantastic site that organizes gems around the world, categorizes them and evaluates their rating according to contributions, updates, download statistics, etc. That was impressive for me; there was a giant haystack but it was easy to find the needle, in fact, there was several needles each of them with pretty good quality; DRY was covered. Despite of having tons of 3rd party libraries to use, quality and organization were what really got me, I used to spent hours trying several libraries to find out which one was the right for me to use, many times you found buggy ones, sometimes you realize that you were looking at the wrong library. [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/), [Ruby-Toolbox](https://www.ruby-toolbox.com/) and the Ruby community made it well, it was easy to find what I want and whatever you were looking most of the times there is some library to help you, I miss that on other languages where there is more dispersion.

Every Ruby book or post I read spoke about TDD and BDD, these weren’t new concepts for me because I was already convinced of the necessity of testing the software I produce, but It was new for me to find authors encouraging you to develop a testing philosophy while introducing you the language. That’s why the Ruby community shines in matters of quality, innovation and confidence, it feels good to be taught in that way.

While creating and/or contributing gems you got sane (or should I say holy?) defaults: solid contribution guidelines, semantic versioning guidelines, coding style guides just to name a few. You are completely covered, having the tools to measure quality, identify potential bugs, code organization, etc you are fully confident to write code and put you focus on what really matters: what your applications needs to do.

After a few months of study I decided to move away from Java and embrace Ruby and its ecosystem, now I speak in terms of [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29) instead of [GoF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns), I’m lately using elements of [FP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming), Data Inmutability and it feels like I could innovate on the last trends of IT, I can count with BDD & TDD, software quality and object oriented design on my toolset and also with top quality Frameworks and libraries, such as Rails, with IT influencers which are first class the same as Events and Conferences around the world.

It’s been almost 5 years and I haven’t regret it, I don’t think I will. Thanks Ruby for opened my mind in that way, now I think of myself as a better professional capable of choosing tools, technologies and languages based on a complex scheme mostly based on what I’ve learnt from the Ruby ecosystem which is a productivity multiplexer, thanks again Ruby, I can’t ask for more.

I plan to write about the tools I use on my daily basis, stay tunned.
